# tst demo

> This repository is meant to contain a set of
> [tst](https://github.com/daltonserey/tst) demonstration
> activities. Currently, however, it has only minimal data to
> support testing tst itself.

To use this repository, install
[`tst`](https://github.com/daltonserey/tst), then run the command
`tst checkout <activity_key>` (the key of each activity can be found
between parentheses below). This will download the files of the
named activity into a directory, where you will be able to answer
the exercise and run the automated tests.


## Activities available

- [Hello, World!](hello/hello.md) (`hello`)
- [Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin](conversions/conversions.md) (`conversions`)
