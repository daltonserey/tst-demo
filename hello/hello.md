# Hello, World! [![PortuguÃªs](https://github.com/daltonserey/FlagKit/raw/master/Assets/PNG/BR.png)](hello_pt.md)

Write a program that prints the message `Hello, World!`.

## Step by step

1. Download the activity, using `tst checkout hello@demo`

2. Create a file with your answer, using the editor of your
   choice. You can name it however you want, but let us assume it
   is named `hello.py`.

3. Test your answer with the tests provided within the activity
file `public_tests.py`, available within the activity directory.
Use the command `tst`.

   > You can run `tst` without arguments (and that is what you
   > will usually do). However, you might want to run `tst
   > hello.py` with the name of the file you created as argument
   > (in fact, any part of the name of the file will be enough).
   > This will make `tst` run the tests on that file only. When
   > `tst` has a single answer file to run tests it reports the
   > results in the so called _debug_ style, making it more
   > useful to understand the errors and fails reported.

4. Rewrite your program until you pass all tests. That is, untill
the summary reported by `tst` is a sequence of dots (`.......`,
assuming there are 7 tests).
